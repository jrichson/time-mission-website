# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-29)

**Core value:** The migrated site must preserve the existing customer-facing experience and conversion paths while making the site easier to maintain, measure, optimize, and scale.
**Current focus:** Phase 11 — small-mobile-responsiveness-480px-tier-cookie-banner-placeme

## Current Position

Phase: 11 (small-mobile-responsiveness-480px-tier-cookie-banner-placeme) — COMPLETE
Plan: 5 of 5
Plans: **52/52** (40 v1 roadmap + 7 Phase 10 + 5 Phase 11)
Status: Cutover-ready (all 11 phases closed; verify chain green)
Last activity: 2026-05-06 -- Completed quick task 260505-qod: migrated lincoln/mount-prospect/manassas/west-nyack to Astro three-fragment wrappers (16 new files, npm run check exits 0)

Progress: All 11 phases documented and shipped; v1 requirement coverage **43/43** (Phases 10 + 11 extend SEO/COMP/DATA/ANLY/VER/FND practices, no new requirement IDs).

**Recent trend:**

- **Phase 11 closed 2026-05-05**: 5 plans shipped closing the launch-blocking responsive gap from Phase 10 UAT test 8 (severity major, ≤425px viewports). Wave summary: (W1) 11-01 ≤480 tier across `nav.css` / `footer.css` / `faq.css` / `base.css` / `newsletter.css`; 11-02 ≤480 tier across 7 partials (`about`, `contact`, `faq`, `locations`, `birthdays`, `legal`, `houston`); 11-03 POLISH-01 cookie banner `.cm--box` rewrite (`rgba(20,20,24,0.92)` surface, orange 18% border, 220ms `cubic-bezier` slide-up, mobile <640 full-width minus 16px gutter above iOS home indicator). (W2) 11-04 Playwright `small mobile (375x667)` describe with no-horizontal-scroll on 4 pages + `.footer-legal` wrap + `.location-btn` / `.btn-tickets` ≥ 44×44 tap targets, plus 8 visual baselines refreshed. (W3) 11-05 verify chain green + ROADMAP/STATE bookkeeping. Tap-target floor preserved throughout. `npm run verify` and `npm run verify:phase10` both exit 0.
- **Phase 10 closed 2026-05-05**: 7 plans shipped covering 13 P0/P1 audit code gaps. Wave summary: (W1) SSR landmarks + skip-link + axe `dist` scan + Playwright mobile project + P0-7a `js/nav.js` `stopPropagation` fix; (W2) 6 legal-page Astro migrations with shared `legal-inline.raw.css.txt` partial; (W3) per-route `lang` prop + `antwerp.html` → `antwerp.astro` + `check-hreflang-cluster` validator; (W4) hero medium audit (zero IMG_SINGLE candidates) + `web-vitals@5.2.0` RUM beacon (consent-gated); (W5) EU-routed cookie banner (`vanilla-cookieconsent@3.1.0`) + `check-tap-targets` validator + `.btn-tickets` 48px / `.location-btn` 44px fixes; (W6) `docs/cutover-checklist.md` + `verify:phase10` alias + ROADMAP/STATE update. The 7 host/external items (P1-7, P1-10, P1-11, P1-17, P2-8, P2-9, P2-10) and P2-6 brand compliance are recorded in `docs/cutover-checklist.md` for human owners.
- Phase 10 highest-leverage single fix: Antwerp schema rename + `alternateName` shipped pre-planning via quick-task 260504-lsk.
- Phase 9: Ticket options SSoT, `compile-route-artifacts`, `locationsFingerprint` + stale analytics event, `scripts/lib/policy-runner.js` + booking policies, `TMFacade` + `docs/tm-public-api.md`, footer/newsletter CSS isolation, `ticket-panel.css` on lean layouts; optional **CSS partial split** remains discretionary backlog (RFC program closed).

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initial release is parity-first: no redesign, no runtime framework rewrite, no full i18n, no CMS, no SSR/hybrid default.
- Canonical routes are clean extensionless paths with no trailing slash; legacy `.html` URLs redirect directly to clean paths.
- GTM is the primary browser analytics integration with Consent Mode v2-ready hooks and dedupe-ready event identity.
- ROLLER remains checkout; outbound booking intent is required, purchase validation depends on available ROLLER/GTM access.
- Old static site must remain deployable until Astro launch is verified.
- **Phase 9:** Public browser extension surface for booking/locations is **`TMFacade`** + documented APIs; new check rules favor policy tables over one-off scripts.

### Roadmap Evolution

- 2026-05-04 — Phase 10 added: Audit-Gap Closure & Cutover Readiness. Origin: external SEO/A11y/Security/Performance audit (39 findings) coverage analysis identified 13 code gaps remaining in Astro + 9 host/external dependencies. See `.planning/phases/10-audit-gap-closure-cutover-readiness/10-CONTEXT.md`.
- 2026-05-05 — Phase 10 closed: 7 plans shipped covering 13 P0/P1 audit code gaps; 7 host/external items + P2-6 brand compliance recorded in `docs/cutover-checklist.md` for human owners; `verify:phase10` exits 0 end-to-end. v1.0 milestone code work complete; remaining items are human-led cutover steps.
- 2026-05-05 — Phase 11 added: small-mobile responsiveness ≤480px tier + cookie banner placement polish. Origin: Phase 10 UAT discovered serious responsiveness issues at viewports ≤425px (footer columns not stacking, button sizes, copy sizes). Bundles RESP-01 (major — `@media (max-width: 480px)` tier across `nav.css`/`footer.css`/`faq.css` + 15 page-local partials) and POLISH-01 (minor — cookie banner bottom-left card placement per ui-design-brain spec). Full diagnosis in `.planning/phases/10-audit-gap-closure-cutover-readiness/10-UAT.md` Gaps section.
- 2026-05-05 — Phase 11 closed: ≤480 small-mobile tier shipped across 5 shared CSS + 7 partials; POLISH-01 cookie banner placement implemented in `css/cookie-consent.css`; Playwright 375×667 smoke locked in. Cutover gate `npm run verify:phase10` remains green; v1 requirement coverage unchanged at 43/43.

### Pending todos

- **Cutover gate**: `npm run verify:phase10` must exit 0 before launch (currently green); see `docs/cutover-checklist.md` for the full 8-step Final Pre-Cutover Sequence.
- **Host action P1-7** (Web Dev): Cloudflare case-insensitive routing — verify on preview per `docs/cloudflare-preview-validation.md`.
- **Host action P1-10** (Product + Brand): ROLLER / Experience Factory brand strategy decision; document in cutover checklist.
- **Host action P1-11** (GTM Admin): FB & TikTok pixel `domain=.timemission.com` fix in GTM container.
- **Host action P1-17** (DevOps): `tickets.timemission.com` DNS + CSP — either deploy subdomain OR migrate booking URLs to `ecom.roller.app` then remove from `_headers`.
- **Host action P2-8** (Designer): Re-export `share-image.jpg` (586 KB → ~150 KB).
- **Host action P2-9** (Designer + Web Dev): Compress `brochure.pdf` (11.7 MB → ~2–3 MB).
- **Host action P2-10** (DevOps): Narrow `api-1.timemission.com` CORS to `https://timemission.com` if PII-bound.
- **Manual review P2-6** (Designer): Brand compliance review against `assets/mockup-reference/`.
- Human: Rehearse `docs/cloudflare-preview-validation.md` on a real Cloudflare Pages preview.
- Human: Confirm ROLLER/GTM validation (including cross-domain / purchase) with Venue Manager or playground access — `docs/roller-booking-launch-checklist.md`.
- Optional: Split group event inline CSS partials (discretionary cleanup; not an open RFC).

### Blockers / concerns

- ROLLER purchase validation depends on Venue Manager or playground access.
- Consent/CMP implementation details and form backend/provider remain open planning decisions.
- Linux CI may need committed Playwright screenshot baselines for `chromium-linux` if tests run on Ubuntu (see `docs/verification-pipeline.md`).

## Session continuity

**All 11 v1.0 phases shipped (Phase 10 + 11 closed 2026-05-05).** Cutover gate is `npm run verify:phase10` (passes end-to-end against current state, including the new small-mobile 375×667 smoke) + `docs/cutover-checklist.md` host items + `docs/rollback-runbook.md` rehearsal. The roadmap's code work is done; remaining items are human-led: Cloudflare preview rehearsal, ROLLER/GTM validation, the 7 host/external dependencies in the cutover checklist, and the P2-6 brand compliance review.
